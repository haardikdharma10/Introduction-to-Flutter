# Introduction-to-Flutter

This repository contains basic, beginner-friendly and assorted Flutter apps that were part of the [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp Course](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart) which I completed. Each app folder has a separate README.md file each of which lists my learnings from each project.
